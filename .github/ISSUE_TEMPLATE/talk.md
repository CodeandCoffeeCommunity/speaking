## About You

**A quick bio:**

Self-taught software engineer with 7 years of experience. For the last two years I have worked as an instructor teaching at Pursuit.org. Prior to that I worked at B&H Photo as a Front End Engineer.

In my free time, I've developed [CodeTrack](https://www.codetrack.dev/), a free platform for guiding and tracking developers to career success. 

## Your Talk

**Title:**
Options: 
1. Leading With Your Work: How to get Interviews with No Resume
2. CodeTrack: How I Built This

**What your talk is about:**

1.Leading With Your Work

When I was looking for my first job, I didn't have anything relevant on my resume. No degree, no highschool diploma, no GED, no relevant work experience. I had to rely on my work to get interviews and then my skill to get me through the interview. 

Here is a link to [an article](https://www.codetrack.dev/articles/one-great-project) touching on the same theme.

Here is a [slide show](https://slides.com/jordanmanley-1/deck) that I might use but it gives a good idea of the talk.

2. CodeTrack: How I Built This

CodeTrack utilizes several APIs in non-traditional ways. It's required creativity and reaching out to some companies to see if they would make changes to their API so that I could integrate with it better. 

CodeTrack is a fun product to explore as it is part education, part game and part resume for developers. 

I would focus on one-two features and break them apart to show how I built them.
